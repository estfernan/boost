Description: Detect spatially variable (SV) genes in spatial transcriptomics 
  (ST) data using the models proposed in Jiang et al. (2021) <arXiv:2104.13957>
  and Li et al. (2020) <arXiv:2012.03326>, as well as other standard procedures.
  The package implements the BOOST-Ising and BOOST-GP models, other standard 
  statistical techniques, data preprocessing techniques, and other 
  miscellaneous diagnostic tools. Model parameters can be tuned automatically 
  for the MCMC procedure. Methods like plot() and print() are available for 
  convinience. This package utilizes the Armadillo C++ library for 
  linear algebra & scientific computing <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>.
