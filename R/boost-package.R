##' boost: Bayesian Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics Data
##'
##' This package provides functions to detect genes with spatial expression
##' pattern, also known as spatially variable (SV) genes, in spatial
##' transcriptomics (ST) data. Two major and novel Bayesian models are
##' implemented via a Gaussian process or Ising model. In addition, it also
##' provides other standard statistical tools such as SPARK, binSpect, etc.
##' Utilities are available to normalize count data, dichotomise expression
##' levels, get spatial neighbors, and view the results of the procedures.
##'
##' See Jiang et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2020) for details and illustrations
##' of how the Bayesian models are fitted and their applications.
