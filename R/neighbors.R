##' Get Neighborhood Information
##'
##' Obtain a long format of the adjacency matrix, specifically, for the
##' geospatial profile of the spatial transcriptomics (ST) data.
##'
##' Generally, for 10X and ST data, the number of neighbors are 6 and 4,
##' respectively. These values represent how the spots are arranged in a
##' lattice. For example, 6 and 4 indicate a hexagonal and square tiling,
##' respectively.
##'
##' The neighboring spots are obtained by two possible methods, where the
##' neighbors are obtained via a (1) distance threshold, which sets a cutoff
##' value, or the (2) k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which chooses the closest
##' neighbors in distance. Additionally, for method (1), a spot might not have
##' a full connectivity.
##'
##' See Jiang et al. (2021) for an introduction to the lattice grid system.
##'
##' @param spots An \eqn{n}-by-\eqn{2} numeric matrix \eqn{T} to represent the
##'   geospatial profile, where each row indicates the spot location in
##'   the grid.
##' @param n.neighbor An integer value that denotes the number of neighbors or
##'   connectivity. See "Details" for more information.
##' @param method An optional character string that specifies the method to
##'   obtain the neighboring spots. The default is "distance" to set
##'   a cutoff value.
##'
##' @return A numeric matrix that denotes the long format of the
##'   adjacency matrix. Each entry denotes the neighbor for spot \eqn{i}. If a
##'   spot does not have full connectivity, then the latest entry or entries
##'   are zero.
